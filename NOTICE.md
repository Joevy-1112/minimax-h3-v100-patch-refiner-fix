# Provenance and validation notice

## Release

- Package version: `0.1.3`
- Default delivery: standalone ComfyUI Custom Node loaded at runtime
- Target GPU: NVIDIA Tesla V100 / CUDA compute capability 7.0
- Current reported compatibility: ComfyUI `0.33.2`
- Profile: successful L3 native-FP16 storage/branch profile with FP32 safety islands

## Precision-profile provenance

Version 0.1.3 promotes the successful, debug-free L3 profile to the formal release:

- Native FP16 weights through ComfyUI loading, prefetch and offload.
- FP16 QKV, Q/K RMSNorm, RoPE and text/video attention in the main DiT blocks.
- FP32 target/reference-audio attention recomputation.
- Power-of-two scaling around FP16 attention output projection and MLP `fc2`.
- FP32 main residual, Block Norm, AdaLN/modulation, condition input, Token Refiner, SwiGLU intermediates, final AdaLN and video/audio heads.

Full-FP16 final heads remain excluded. The implementation does not mutate `weight.data`, retain a complete FP32 weight mirror across blocks, or convert full weights inside `forward`.

## Runtime implementation

- Registers FP16 as a supported MiniMax H3 inference dtype before model construction so ComfyUI owns the FP16 weight lifecycle.
- Enables the profile only on native-FP16 main DiT blocks; the Token Refiner remains outside the accelerated block profile.
- Preserves target/reference-audio row ranges through task-local runtime context.
- Uses `/64 → FP16 out_proj → FP32 ×64` and `/256 → FP16 fc2 → FP32 ×256`.
- Forces `condition_proj` input and both final output heads through FP32 safety paths.
- Refuses unsupported GPUs, unfamiliar ComfyUI H3 structures, source patches, pre-existing FP16 dtype providers and late runtime conflicts.
- Contains no per-forward allocator telemetry, OOM diagnostic interception, cache clearing, CUDA synchronization or peak-counter reset.
- Does not modify any ComfyUI source file.

## Validation completed on 2026-08-18

- The user reported that the L3 profile successfully reduced inference-period resident VRAM while keeping inference performance unchanged.
- The user reported successful operation with ComfyUI 0.33.2.
- Fourteen dependency-free tests cover version reporting, V100 restriction, native-FP16 registration, main-block/Token-Refiner isolation, dtype flow, FP32 audio/final safety, power-of-two scaling, idempotence, early/late conflict refusal, no lazy weight mutation, no source writes and no allocator debug telemetry.
- The promoted release compute-kernel AST hashes match the successful L3 profile.

Target-GPU results remain workload-specific; users should hold model, seed, prompt, sampler, steps, dimensions, attention backend, offload mode and power limit constant when comparing releases.

## Compatibility boundary

This is the standalone v0.1.3 runtime profile. It must not be stacked with TE-Speed or another H3 runtime/dtype patch. A separately reviewed adapter is required for combined execution.

## Legacy patcher

The earlier guarded source patchers, restore scripts, source snapshots, their original manifest and detailed provenance notice remain under `legacy_patcher/`. They are retained for recovery and development and are not the recommended v0.1.3 installation path.

This is a community extension, not an official MiniMax, ComfyUI, NVIDIA, PyTorch, TE-Speed or acknowledged-project release.

## Downstream modification (refiner-fix, 2026-08-30)

This distribution modifies v0.1.3 (same package version, suffixed `+refiner-fix`):

- `RefinerBlock.forward` now routes through an FP32-residual path (norm → FP16 cast → attention/MLP → FP32 residual add) and its blocks receive the same enable flags as main DiT blocks. Rationale: the wrapped FP32 `condition_proj` output feeds the Token Refiner; with the refiner outside the accelerated profile, the FP32 residual hits a stock FP16-weight `qkv_proj` and fails with `float != c10::Half` on ComfyUI 0.33.1. The upstream "Token Refiner remains outside" boundary is precisely what this fix closes.
- Added opt-in numeric tracing (`H3_FP16_TRACE`, `H3_FP16_TRACE_PATH` env vars; off by default, no hardcoded paths).
- Structure validation extended to `RefinerBlock.forward` (signature + source markers); rollback path covers the new hook.

Verification on 2×V100-16G, ComfyUI 0.33.1, torch 2.8.0+cu126: 124-frame 480p clip with audio, ~29.5 s/it (vs 55–85 s/it INT8 eager), 0 NaN/0 Inf across all 50 DiT blocks + refiner, no black frames.
